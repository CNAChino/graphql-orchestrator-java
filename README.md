### Overview

**GraphQL Orchestrator** is a library that exposes data from various data providers using a single unified GraphQL schema.
It aggregates and combines the schemas from these data providers and orchestrates the graphql queries to the appropriate services.


It uses the [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) library as the runtime execution engine on the unified schema.
